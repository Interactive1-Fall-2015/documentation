					History
					<br>
					<span>The camera was produced in 1993. It is a 35mm SLR camera, and was only sold in the American market. It was one of the many EF mounts that were produced leading up into the digital age of photography.<br><br>
					I obtained this camera as my first film camera for a photography course back in high school. I found it at a swap meet without a lens for about $25. I had a 50mm f/1.8 that I got with my digital Canon, so I used that for time being until my uncle gave me his lens off his old Canon ELAN.<br><br><br><br><a href="index.html">Back</a></span>
