			 <p>DP: I studied at central saint martins in london and during a work placement in my second year (with phaidon), I fell in love with book design. from that point on, I tried to pin down a job within the industry and on graduation, began working as a text designer for penguin (setting the insides of books) before moving over to covers a year later. I worked in-house there for five years and have worked on my own for the seven years since.</p>
