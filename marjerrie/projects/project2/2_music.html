			<p class="question_a">
				what’s been the biggest change since deciding to leave <a href="https://www.theonlybandever.com/alexisonfire/">alexisonfire</a> (pictured above) and work solely on city and colour?
			</p>
				<p>The biggest change is having the focus just mainly on one thing, which has been nice. One of the reasons for leaving Alexis was so that I could focus and give everything I have to City and Colour. But in doing that, I think I’ve offered up too much to it now. It’s become what I imagined it could be, or hoped it would be, which is good. But at the same time, it’s almost like…careful what you wish for.</p>

			<p class="question">
				do you think then that your success came to fast?
			</p>
				<p>No, I don’t think so, because it’s sorta always been bubbling. I mean, I’ve been doing it a long time. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sometimes/id433270988">“Sometimes”</a> came out in 2005, that’s seven years ago now. But I think what happened was that it was building, building and building and then all of a sudden, I was like, “Okay, here I go” and it was like, “Well, here we come too.” So it’s sorta weird. The American tour that we just did was really, really crazy, because it was in really big places and we sold out in city’s that I’ve never been and that was really surprising. I mean, Canada is one thing, I’ve been working at it for a while in Canada and they’ve always welcomed me with open arms. But anywhere else I go, I feel like I’m going to walk into a room and no one is going to show up. So that was weird to deal with.</p>

			<p class="question">
				do you feel like people always want something from you now?
			</p>
				<p>Yeah. I’ve definitely reached that point. Not a day goes by where someone doesn’t come up to me on the street, but thankfully the people that come up to me are usually quite nice. They’re not like belligerent or rude. Like today, I was at lunch a girl came up to me after I finished and said, “I don’t mean to bother you, but can I have an autograph?” I said, “Of course.” On my way here, someone walked by and just said, “Mr. Green.” Which is nice, but it’s something that is interesting to adapt to, you’re no longer being able to walk around without one person, that you don’t know, coming up to you and talking to you.</p>

			<p class="question">
				by choosing a career in music, do you feel like maybe you asked for it?
			</p>
				<p>Absolutely. When you’re putting your music out and you’re asking people to buy it, or come see you play, you’re giving yourself to them at some point. And I’ve always enjoyed talking to be people about it.I don’t think I’ve ever been one to shoo them away, just because I feel like, without the people coming and listening, then I don’t have anyone to play for. But I think I’m starting to learn that there has to come a time where I have to separate it at some point. I think I’m realizing that I’m giving too much of myself to it and when I get home, I have nothing left to give to my family. Emotionally, I’m finding that I’m becoming a little bit disconnected with the people who are truly in my life.</p>

			<p class="question">
				how do you think you can make the separation happen?
			</p>
				<p>I don’t know. I’m just sorta starting to get to this point and then I have to move forward and figure it out. I guess the first step is to realize what that problem is and work towards fixing it.</p>

			<p class="question">
				i guess that’s what happens when your hobby becomes your career.
			</p>
				<p>For me it was never about this, (signals around to the auditorium), as much as I’d hoped that people would listen to my music, it was more about just writing and singing and playing for anybody. So, I’m so thankful and lucky that I’ve gotten to a point like this, but I’m also not a guy who did this so I could do interviews, be in magazines or be on television. I never wanted to be that guy. But now, I have to learn how to deal with the fact that I am that guy, and how to still maintain a sense of myself and at the same time, becoming this.</p>

			<p class="question_a">
				are there examples of people who’ve walked away and then come back, that come to mind? 
			</p>
				<p>Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_(singer)">Leslie (Feist)</a>, she was away for four years and just recently put out an album. She was just like, fuck it, I’m going to take my time. Whether it was writer’s block or an emotional feeling or whatever, but I’ve always felt compelled to go and play for people. Especially with the City and Colour happening the way it did. When Alexis on Fire would finish, I felt obligated to go and play for all these people who were showing interest in these songs. And then when I was done that, I would have to go and make another Alexis record. I’ve been putting out records steady every year since 2004 and touring.</p>
