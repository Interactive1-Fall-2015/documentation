				<a href="lineargradient.html">Well</a>, years after I made it, one of my New York nephews, who was in his early 20s, said, "Ram's my favorite album. I just love it, man. We play it in college and all that." It totally took me by surprise. And that awoke my interest in the album. Then I started to hear the same thing from a number of people through the years. I think it's because they connect with the liberty to engage, that early-20s kind of thing. It feels like you suddenly have a little bit of chance; you're out of school, not yet in the big serious job. It's a good period to cast around. Some people take a trip to India, Tibet, hitchhike through Europe. This was my trip to Tibet, only it was Scotland. The album is certainly in tune with the freedom that a lot of people want these days in our strange world where bankers can rip the economy apart. It's nice to have a little bit of art to fall back on.
